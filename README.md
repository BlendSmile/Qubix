# Qubix
a 3D pixel art voxel editor
Qubix is an open source 3D, voxel based, pixel art graphic editor with its own procedural compositor and pixelated renderer. Made With Unity for Linux and Windows (maybe mac soon, i gotta find a tester, i don't have a mac)

It can export to FBX, OBJ and import from OBJ. Thank you to Dummiesman and aaro4130 for making the OBJ Importer and exporter (it exist on Unity Asset Store for free).
